# Movie-Search
First practice exercise to consume an API using Fetch in Javascript and create an interactive user interface. 

## Your Task
Build an application using the OMDB api, Javascript Fetch and HTML/CSS to allow a user to view movies from an online database. The features are as follows: 
1. List movies - a user can view a static list of movies, including their title, year and poster image.
2. Search movies - a user can search films by a keyword in a search field so they can only view films that match their query

### Extension
3. Filter - a user can filter movies by year using a filter panel
4. Add to favourites - a user can add selected movies to a favourites section on the page
â€‹
### Super-extension
5. Persistent favourites - a user's favourites remain on the page even if the page is refreshed!

#### Current status 
Completed the filter partially and am in the process of creating favourites.
